In the highly competitive mobile phone market, companies aim to comprehend sales data and the factors that influence prices. The objective is to establish a relationship between the mobile phone's features (such as RAM, internal memory, etc.) and its selling price. The goal is not to predict the exact price but to determine the price range, indicating its relative affordability.

The aim of this project is to predict the price range of mobile phones based on their specifications such as battery power, 3G capability, Wi-Fi connectivity, Bluetooth functionality, RAM, and more.
