# ML_Regression_Bike_Sharing_Demand_Prediction

We have to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts the demand for bike sharing in Seoul, South Korea. The model should take into account various factors such as weather conditions, time of day, day of the week, and other relevant variables to provide accurate predictions of the number of bikes that will be rented at a given time. The goal is to help bike sharing companies optimize their operations, improve resource allocation, and enhance customer satisfaction by ensuring a sufficient supply of bikes at high-demand locations and times.
